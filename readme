##Project Overview
This To-Do List application is a simple web-based task manager built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The application enables users to add, mark as complete, and delete tasks, with changes stored in the browser's localStorage for persistence.
The user interface is designed with a clean, minimalistic layout, and each task entry has a checkbox to mark as complete, a delete button, and some formatting customization

##Key Features =>
Add Task: Users can add tasks via an input box, with the first letter capitalized and any digits bolded.
Mark Task Complete: Click on a task to toggle its "completed" state.
Delete Task: Each task includes a delete button, allowing users to remove it from the list.
Persistent Storage: Tasks are stored in localStorage so they remain even after refreshing the page.
Responsive Design: The layout is flexible and adapts to various screen sizes


##Project Structure =>
HTML: Defines four main <div> elements:
   1.Container: Main div holding all other sections.
   2.Heading: Displays the project title and an image.
   3.Tasks: Contains an input box and an "Add" button for new tasks.
   4.List: Holds an unordered list that dynamically shows tasks when added.
CSS: Manages styling for layout, color gradients, and button effects.
JavaScript: Provides interactive functionality and local storage support.

##Java Script Functions=>
addTask(): Validates the input, creates a list item (<li>) with the task. The span with a close button is appended to each list item for removal functionality. Shows the List Div upon adding a task.
Event Listener on listcontainer: Enables task completion toggling by checking/unchecking and allows task removal by clicking the close button (<span>).
saveData(): Saves the current list of tasks in localStorage.
showTask(): Loads tasks from localStorage upon page load and displays them in the List Div.

Note:
The application will only display the task list div when there are tasks. If no tasks are added, the list will be hidden.
